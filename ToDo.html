      <p>
        There are many activities that you could do during your trip to Puerto Rico. In the pueblos, there are many authentic restaurants serving items such as quesitos, pastelitos, relleno de papa, bacalao, and many more staple Puerto Rican dishes.
        If you're a trendsetter loking for the next hottest fashion trend, you could take a stop at Plaza de las Americas, which is the largest mall in the Caribbean. 
        Or for our history buffs, you could take a guided tour through El Morro de San Juan which is where battles took place in the Spanish-American War. 
        Below is a list of activities and places that could be on your list of things to do during a trip to the beautiful island of Puerto Rico.
